This Morse Code Converter project was a great opportunity to dive deeper into file handling, recursion, and binary trees. I learned how to use a tree structure to store and retrieve data efficiently, which was an essential concept for the project. By implementing Morse code conversion, I gained hands-on experience working with trees, which helped me understand their role in organizing and searching data.

Another key part of the project was converting Morse code into English and vice versa, ensuring proper handling of spaces between letters and words. This helped me understand the importance of string manipulation and how to manage different delimiters in a structured format. The file-based test case presented some challenges, but it was a valuable exercise in handling file input and output, teaching me how to read data from a file and convert it correctly.

Overall, the project enhanced my problem-solving skills and gave me a clearer understanding of tree structures and their applications. It also improved my ability to work with files in Java, making me more confident in using these techniques in future projects. This experience helped me connect theory with practice and strengthened my coding abilities.
