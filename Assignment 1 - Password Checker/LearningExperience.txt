I learned how to use regex expression. It's understandable but when it comes to checking sequence and special characters, it gets confusing. For instance, "((.)\\2{2,})". I looked up tutorials on how to implement pattern and matcher to enhance my understanding of the topic. Regular expressions are a powerful tool that I’ve learned to use for pattern matching and text manipulation. With Java’s Pattern and Matcher classes, I can efficiently search, validate, and process strings based on patterns.

Learning about exceptions has helped me understand how to manage unexpected errors and maintain control over the flow of a program. I now know that exceptions allow me to prevent my program from crashing due to runtime errors like invalid input or division by zero.

These concepts have made my code more resilient and efficient. Handling exceptions helps me maintain program stability, while regex allows me to work with strings in a flexible and powerful way. Both of these skills will continue to be valuable as I progress in Java development.
